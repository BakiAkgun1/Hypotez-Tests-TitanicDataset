## Titanic Dataset Analysis
# Overview
This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on visualizations and hypothesis testing to explore relationships between various features, particularly 'age' and 'fare' columns. The analysis aims to uncover insights and patterns within the data.

# Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic. You can pull with seaborn library this dataset. The key columns used in this analysis include:

Sex: Gender of the passengers
Class: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Age: Age of the passengers
Fare: Ticket fare paid by the passengers
# Visualization
Various visualizations were created to explore the distribution and relationships between the features. Key visualizations include:
